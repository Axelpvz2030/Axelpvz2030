## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m Axel, I have been a developer of content for the Minecraft bedrock marketplace for 7 years, and I'm currently studying computer engineering, I'm also a member in training of SIAFI

## About me ðŸ’–

-I speak broken English but can hold a conversation properly if you donÂ´t mind talking to a caveman :p
-I'm obsessed with video games, I like playing them, watching videos about them, or creating content based on them for others, the reason for my current job
-I know a bit of C, C++, java javascript, and python
-I'm good at creating new and fresh ideas âœ¨, but not so much documenting them properly for others to understand me 
-Can make for a good leader in a pinch, but I prefer being more of a support for the team
-If I put my mind to something I wonÂ´t sleep until I get it done in the best state i possibly can
